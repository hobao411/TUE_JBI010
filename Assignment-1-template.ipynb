Borges was an outstanding Argentinian writer who wrote about time, space, destiny, and reality. \"The Library of Babel\" is one of his most famous short stories. In this story, Borges presents an idea of a universe represented as a library that contains all possible books, written in all possible languages build atop 25 symbols that include: 22 lower-case letters of the alphabet, the comma, the period, and the space. We encourage you to read the whole story (you can find the PDF version [here](https://sites.evergreen.edu/politicalshakespeares/wp-content/uploads/sites/226/2015/12/Borges-The-Library-of-Babel.pdf)).

You have also helped in the understanding and analysis of one of the most beautiful and intriguing pieces of literature of the $XX^{th}$ century. From now on, every time you need to solve a problem, follow the analysis steps that we practised; you should always identify the problem or question you need to solve, the inputs, the output, and the algorithm to implement your solution. Take your time to do this, it will save you time and effort!\n",

He also posited a fact which all travelers have since confirmed: In all the Library, there are no two identical books. \n",
